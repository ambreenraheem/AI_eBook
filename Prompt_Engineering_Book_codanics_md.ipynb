        "## Getting the best results from an LLM requires more than just asking simple questions. Master these essential techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Zero-Shot Prompting:** Ask directly without examples.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in simple terms.\n",
        "### **2.Few-Shot Prompting:** Guide the LLM with a few examples.\n",

        "\n",
        "Analyze sentiment of these customer reviews for a Karachi restaurant:\n",
        "\n",
        "Review: “The biryani was amazing, best I’ve had!”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment: Positive\n",
        "Review: “Service was very slow, waited 30 mins for water.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment: Negative\n",
        "\n",
        "Review: “Food was okay, but the ambiance was nice.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3.Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: A Lahore clothing brand sold 1200 kurtas in Week 1. Sales increased by 15% in Week 2. How many kurtas were sold in Week 2? Let’s think step by step.\n",
        "### **4.Role Playing:** Assign a persona to the LLM for more relevant responses.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Act as a data analyst for a Pakistani telecom company. Suggest 3 KPIs to track customer churn based on usage data.\n",
        "### **5. Providing Context:** Supply background information for better answers.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "I’m analyzing ride-sharing data from Lahore (columns: ‘RideID’, ‘PickupTime’, ‘DropoffTime’, ‘Fare’, ‘PickupLocation’, ‘DropoffLocation’). Suggest Python code using pandas to calculate the average ride duration for trips starting near MM Alam Road.\n",
        "### **6. Specifying Output Format:** Request structured outputs (e.g., lists, tables, JSON).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "List the top 5 Python libraries for data visualization. Provide the answer as a numbered list."
